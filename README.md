# EnrollmentFileAssessment

Sample utility for an assessment. It takes the a csv file as an input and splits records into their own csv files by company. 
The records are sorted first by last name then by first name. Duplicate records are ignored unless they have a higher version number.

When utility runs enter the name of the csv file you are importing. The file must be in the utility's root directory.

I've included a sample csv file with 1000+ entries and sample output files that were generated when parsing the sample file.
